# My participation in the LBS Clubs

Throughout the past year, I engaged with the LBS community through my participation in two clubs:

*Investment Management Club* 

I joined the Investment Management Club (IMC) Executive Committee as part of the "Speaker Series" events - which involves bringing investment professionals to the school to discuss different topics with the student body and giving lectures on what is happening in financial markets. Some of the events we hosted throughout the year were:

-   In conversation with Mark Lewis, Head of Climate Research at Andurand Capital Management

-   Fireside Chat with Hedge Fund Managers - Adam Iqbal & Patrick Boyle

-   Finance Club and IMC speaker event with Prof. Richard Portes and David Bloom, ex-Global Head of FX Research, HSBC

-   Presentation and Networking with Fiera Capital

-   In conversation with Daniel Imhof, Global head of Investment Management at Credit Suisse: Market Outlook, perspectives and insights

-   Fireside chat with Schroeders and Value Capital Partners

*Rugby Club* 

I also played for the Rugby Club - the LBS Hawaiians - as a Winger and joined the club in domestic and international matches, such as our European tour when we went to Spain to play a local team in Madrid:
