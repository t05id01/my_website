# Investment Competitions

Throughout my first year as an MBA student, I used the Investment competitions as a way to practice new ways to analyse securities such as Stocks and Bonds, prepare professional presentations that could be delivered to an Investment Committee, and participate in the life cycle of an investment idea from inception to communication with the judges.

**Investment Competition - London Business School, November 2022**

For this competition, we pitched AT&T's Common stock with a 22% upside and our team was awarded with the 1st place in the competition. Below there is a summary of our thesis along with a picture of our presentation:

**NYU Stern Credit Pitch competition, October 2022**

This competition had a focus on Fixed Income securities and was held virtually. We also pitched AT&T, but this time around we focused on Senior Unsecured Notes. This competition was particularly challenging due to the difficulty in communicating properly with the judges via Zoom. Nevertheless, our thesis was strong and we were awarded the 3rd place in this competition. Below is a summary of our investment thesis:

**University of Virgina Darden Investment Competition, September 2022**

This was the first competition I participated, and it was held at the University of Virginia Darden in the US. We pitched PSA, an american self-storage company. It was a great learning experience and we got to travel to the US and interact with several students from other top business schools.
