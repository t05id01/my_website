# Investment Competitions

Throughout my first year as an MBA student, I used the Investment competitions as a way to practice new ways to analyse securities such as Stocks and Bonds, prepare a professional presentation that could be delivered to an Investment Committee, and participate in the life cycle of an investment idea from inception to communication with the judges.

**Investment Competition - London Business School, November 2022**

For this competition, we pitched AT&T's Common stock with a 22% upside and our team was awarded with the 1st place in the competition. Below there is a summary of our thesis along with a picture of our presentation:

**NYU Stern Credit Pitch competition, October 2022**

This competition had a focus on Fixed Income securities and was held virtually. This competition was particularly challenging due to the difficulty in communicacting properly with the judges via Zoom. Nevertheless, our thesis was strong and we were awarded the 3rd place in this compatition. Below is a summary of our investment thesis:
